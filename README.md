# Machine-Learning

I'll host all of my projects related to machine learning here.

All files with the extension .ipynb were created using Jupyter Notebooks (coded in Python). 

Many files are exercises or code-alongs I completed while following this Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/complete-guide-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning-with-python/learn/v4/content by Jose Portilla. 

Files ending in "Exercise" were assignments which I got a prompt for and used examples/notes to complete on my own, while most other files are code-alongs that I did while watching the lectures in order to learn material.
