# Machine-Learning

I'll host all of my projects related to machine learning here.

All files with the extension .ipynb were created using Jupyter Notebooks. 

Many files are exercises or code-alongs I completed while following this Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/complete-guide-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning-with-python/learn/v4/content by Jose Portilla.
