# Machine-Learning

I'll host all of my projects related to machine learning here.

All files with the extension .ipynb were created using Jupyter Notebooks (coded in Python). 

Many files are exercises or code-alongs I completed while following this Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/complete-guide-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning-with-python/learn/v4/content by Jose Portilla.
